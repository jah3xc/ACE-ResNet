	abstract = {One of the fundamental challenges for a hyperspectral imaging system is the detection and discrimination of subpixel objects in background clutter. The background surrounding the object, which acts as interference, provides the major obstacle to successful detection and discrimination. In many applications we look for a single signature and discrimination among different signatures is not required. However, there are important applications where we are interested for multiple signatures. In these cases, the use of spectral discrimination algorithms is both necessary and valuable. In this paper, we develop an approach to spectral discrimination based on the adaptive cosine estimation (ACE) algorithm. The basic idea is to jointly exploit the detection statistics from the various signatures and set a common threshold that ensures larger separation between signatures of interest and background. The operation of the proposed detection-discrimination approach is illustrated using real-world hyperspectral imaging data.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently exhibited an excellent performance in hyperspectral image classification tasks. However, the straightforward CNN-based network architecture still finds obstacles when effectively exploiting the relationships between hyperspectral imaging (HSI) features in the spectral-spatial domain, which is a key factor to deal with the high level of complexity present in remotely sensed HSI data. Despite the fact that deeper architectures try to mitigate these limitations, they also find challenges with the convergence of the network parameters, which eventually limit the classification performance under highly demanding scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new CNN architecture based on spectral-spatial capsule networks in order to achieve a highly accurate classification of HSIs while significantly reducing the network design complexity. Specifically, based on Hinton's capsule networks, we develop a CNN model extension that redefines the concept of capsule units to become spectral-spatial units specialized in classifying remotely sensed HSI data. The proposed model is composed by several building blocks, called spectral-spatial capsules, which are able to learn HSI spectral-spatial features considering their corresponding spatial positions in the scene, their associated spectral signatures, and also their possible transformations. Our experiments, conducted using five well-known HSI data sets and several state-of-the-art classification methods, reveal that our HSI classification approach based on spectral-spatial capsules is able to provide competitive advantages in terms of both classification accuracy and computational time.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, since they adopt deep convolutional layers whose kernels can effectively extract high-level spatial-spectral features. However, sampling locations of traditional convolutional kernels are fixed and cannot be changed according to complex spatial structures in HSIs. In addition, the typical pooling layers (e.g., average or maximum operations) in CNNs are also fixed and cannot be learned for feature downsampling in an adaptive manner. In this letter, a novel deformable CNN-based HSI classification method is proposed, which is called deformable HSI classification networks (DHCNet). The proposed network, DHCNet, introduces the deformable convolutional sampling locations, whose size and shape can be adaptively adjusted according to HSIs' complex spatial contexts. Specifically, to create the deformable sampling locations, 2-D offsets are first calculated for each pixel of input images. The sampling locations of each pixel with calculated offsets can cover the locations of other neighboring pixels with similar characteristics. With the deformable sampling locations, deformable feature images are then created by compressing neighboring similar structural information of each pixel into fixed grids. Therefore, applying the regular convolutions on the deformable feature images can reflect complex structures more effectively. Moreover, instead of adopting the pooling layers, the strided convolution is further introduced on the feature images, which can be learned for feature downsampling according to spatial contexts. Experimental results on two real HSI data sets demonstrate that DHCNet can obtain better classification performance than can several well-known classification methods.},
